# quizzler_flutter

A new Flutter project.

## Notes

By adding angle brackets after declaring the data type of a variable, we define what types of values that variable can accept:
e.g.:

```dart
List<String> myStrings = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']; //this variable can only accept strings.

List<int> myIntegers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // this variable can only accept integers.

List<Widget> scoreKeeper = [Icon(Icons.check, color: Colors.lightGreen)]; //this varriable can only accept a list of Widgets.
```
